# 🚀 Roadmap: AI in Healthcare with NHS FDP & FHIR

**Created on:** 2025-04-17

---

## 🧠 Phase 1: Foundation Setup

### ✅ 1. Learn Healthcare-AI Essentials
- [ ] Basics of AI & ML: classification, regression, clustering
- [ ] Tools: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch
- [ ] Healthcare Datasets: MIMIC-IV, PhysioNet, openEHR samples
- [ ] Courses:
  - [AI for Medicine – Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/ai-for-medicine)
  - [MIT HST.936: AI in Healthcare](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/hst-936-global-health-informatics-to-improve-quality-of-care-spring-2010/)

---

## 🏥 Phase 2: NHS FDP + FHIR Mastery

### ✅ 2. NHS Federated Data Platform (FDP)
- [ ] Understand NHS FDP architecture
- [ ] Register at [developer.nhs.uk](https://developer.nhs.uk/)
- [ ] Learn API access: App creation, keys, permissions
- [ ] Use sandbox APIs (Appointments, Conditions, Observations)

### ✅ 3. FHIR Deep Dive
- [ ] FHIR Resources: Patient, Encounter, Condition, Observation, Medication
- [ ] Learn FHIR Search, Bundles, Query chaining
- [ ] Tools:
  - [HAPI FHIR Server](https://hapifhir.io/)
  - [FHIR Validator](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/Using+the+FHIR+Validator)

---

## 🤖 Phase 3: AI Meets FHIR

### ✅ 4. AI Use Cases on FHIR Data
- [ ] Predictive Modeling: Risk scoring, readmission prediction
- [ ] NLP from clinical notes
- [ ] Use SNOMED CT/ICD/LOINC codes with AI/ML

### 🛠 Example Projects
- [ ] Build NiFi → ML pipeline
- [ ] Train models on FHIR resources
- [ ] Use FHIRPath + Elasticsearch for cohort discovery

---

## 🚀 Phase 4: Deployment & Integration

### ✅ 5. Real-World Workflow
- [ ] NiFi Flow:
  - Ingest → Route → ML Model API → Output predictions
- [ ] Mirth Connect for HL7 ↔ FHIR mapping

---

## 🔒 Phase 5: Security, Ethics, Compliance
- [ ] NHS Data Security & Protection Toolkit (DSPT)
- [ ] GDPR + Explainable AI (SHAP, LIME)

---

## 🌟 Bonus
- [ ] Join communities: [FHIR Chat](https://chat.fhir.org/), NHS Digital Slack
- [ ] Attend HL7/NHS AI webinars
- [ ] Create GitHub project portfolio
